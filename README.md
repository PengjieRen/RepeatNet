This is our implementation for the paper:

Pengjie Ren, Jing Li, Zhumin Chen, Zhaochun Ren, Jun Ma and Maarten de Rijke (2019). RepeatNet: A Repeat Aware Neural Recommendation Machine for Session-based Recommendation. In Proceedings of The Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Please cite our AAAI'19 paper. Thanks!

We would like to thank Jianqiang Sun for pointing out the reverse order issue when processing lastfm data!
